I'm currently a PhD student in Computer Science at Westlake University (jointly with Zhejiang University), supervised by [Prof. Peidong Liu](https://ethliup.github.io/).

I received my Bachelor's degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University at Xi'an, China, and received my Master's degree from Northwestern University at Evanston, IL

My current and past research focus on Computer Vision, Computational Photography, and robotics.

### Biography

I was an undergraduate student at School of Electronic and Information Engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong University between 2015 to 2019. I have been an active member of Xi'an Jiaotong University RoboCup team since entering the college. From fall 2016 to summer 2019, I joined Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robots at Xi'an Jiaotong University, supervised by [Prof. Xuetao Zhang](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/xuetaozh). At summer 2017, I became an exchange student at Boston University at Boston, MA. Later during summer and fall 2018, I visited UCLA Biomechatronics Lab as a research assistant, under the supervision of [Prof. Veronica Santos](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/veronica-santos/). During my master's study in Northwestern, I was a member of Northwestern Computational Photography Lab (CPL) and Image and Video Processing Lab (IVPL). At CPL and IVPL, i was supervised by [Prof. Oliver Cossairt](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/cossairt-oliver.html), [Prof. Florian Willomitzer](https://3dim.northwestern.edu/), [Prof. Aggelos Katsaggelos](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/katsaggelos-aggelos.html) and [Prof. Jack Tumblin](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~jet/). Before joining the Westlake, I was a PhD offer holder at Computing department, Imperial College London.
